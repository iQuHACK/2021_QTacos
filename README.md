# TaQu Fever
*Yareli Aguilar, Alejandro Martínez, Diego Pérez, Isaac Pimentel, Saúl Puente.*
## Synopsis
It's food time and everyone wants to eat at QTacos!
Take orders and make the perfect taco by using awesome quantum gate ingredients!
In TaQu Fever you are the Master Taquero, who has to recreate what customers order. You start with a QTortilla, which is a qubit in an initial quantum state, then you apply different ingredients made of quantum gates, and what you get is an awesome QTaco, which you can see as a qubit in a final quantum state. If this QTaco is the QTaco the customer ordered, you win one point. Don't forget this is a time trial game! What will be your highest record?

## Basic Principles (technical concepts quantum mechanics and quantum computing)

## Motivation/Goals
We want TaQu Fever to be a fun and entertaining quantum game, but also, we want the user to be capable of use and create quantum algorithms, as well as learn about quantum gates and it's effects on the quantum states. By making QTacos, the user, seeing how any ingredient (quantum gate) changes the initial state, adquires experience and motivation to keep making QTacos and do it as fast as he cans to break his own record. With all this, we can say that TaQu Fever is an useful entertaining game with all the posibility to be educational to the user, and also is about delicious quantum food.

## Elements and rules
TaQu Fever is a one player game with the next elements:
* QTacos: is the restaurant where the game takes place.
* Master Taquero: is the user's character.
* QTortilla: initial quantum state.
* Customer: is the client of the restaurant.
* Order: is the expected state the customer ask for (the expected QTaco).
* Ingredients:
  * H - desHebrada: is the Hadamard gate applied to the quantum state.
  * X - Xicken: is the Pauli X gate applied to the quantum state.
  * Y - onYon: is the Pauli Y gate applied to the quantum state.
  * Z - Zilantro: is the Pauli Z gate applied to the quantum state.
  * CNOT - pasNOT: is the CNOT gate applied to the quantum state.
* QTaco: final quantum state.
